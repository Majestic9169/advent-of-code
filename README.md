# Advent of Code

## 2025

This was my first time! I had fun learning new stuff and going down random rabbit holes. This made my holidays a little more fun, thank you [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/)

```
You help the Elves decorate the Christmas trees with all 24 stars! 
Now, the Elves will have plenty of time to prepare for Christmas, 
and you get a well-deserved break.
```

Most of my solutions could absolutely be better, if you have any suggestions please feel free to raise an issue 

- Day 9 Part 2
- and Day 12

are especially bad

Often if I needed hints I would go checkout [@jverkamp](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/12/01/advent-of-code-2025/)'s solutions

To run all the solutions together simply 

```bash
